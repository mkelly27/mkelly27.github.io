      <h3>Nightmare</h3>
      <p>In this Skyrim mod, I attempted to create a horror experience that is
        unlike what a player would normally experience within Skyrim. The
        level is hub based and seamlessly moves the player throughout with no
        backtracking, as shown in the pre-cluttered and pre-lit screenshot.
        The blended cave and castle tileset make the castle look as though it
        was in ruin. Each room attempts to tell a story of those that live
        there, and even the story of the adventurers that wandered through
        this cast after it had been long abandoned.<br><br>As the name
        implies, this level is designed for a mod in which the player is
        having a nightmare, meaning that various assets can be used to create
        a sense of horror to the player, and multiple objects
        (such as gargoyles) can move throughout the level based off of what
        the player is currently doing.<br><br>Role: Level Design</p>
