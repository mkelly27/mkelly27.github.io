    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My interest in Game Design began when I first modded The Elder Scrolls
      IV: Oblivion at the age of 12. From then on, I began to both study and
      create games as they continued to be a valued part of my life. I have
      generally been known as the kind of person that will "play anything,"
      as I find nearly all types of games offer intriguing aspects of design
      for us to study.<br><br>I am currently a senior at George Mason University,
      where I am majoring in Computer Game Design, and minoring in Computer
      Science. Through my time at George Mason, I took a a variety of
      roles in a variety of projects (both curricular, and otherwise). I enjoy
      programming and level design, but specialize in designing gameplay
      systems.<br><br>When designing systems, I use my mathematical and
      programming knowledge to create simple and innovative solutions to
      complex problems.</p>
