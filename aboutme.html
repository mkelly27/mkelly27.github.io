    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My interest in Game Design began when I first modded The Elder Scrolls
      IV: Oblivion at the age of 12. From then on, I began to both study and
      create games as they continued to be a valued part of my life. I have
      generally been known as the kind of person that will "play anything,"
      as I find nearly all types of games offer intriguing aspects of design
      for us to study.<br><br>I am currently a senior at George Mason University,
      where I am majoring in Computer Game Design, and minoring in Computer
      Science. Through my time at George Mason, I took a a variety of
      roles in a variety of projects (both curricular, and otherwise). I enjoy
      programming and level design, but specialize in designing gameplay
      systems.<br><br>When designing systems, I use my mathematical and
      programming knowledge to create simple and innovative solutions to
      complex problems.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Simple Solutions</h3>
      <p>Coming up with an idea is easy. Finding a solution to problems that
        arise from implementing that idea is just as easy. What’s harder is
        finding and defining the right solution.<br><br> That is exactly what I
        strive for. I’m not satisfied with finding a solution, but rather force
        myself to try to find the best solution, and do it as quickly as
        possible. Using all of the knowledge and experience I have gathered, I
        ensure that when I document a new feature or mechanic it solves all of
        our problems, answers all of our questions, is lightweight for
        developers, and has everyone saying “Why didn’t I think of that?”
